This Jupyter Notebook details the analysis of the famous Kaggle dataset entitled "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"
using various data visualisation models and analysis using Machine Learning. 

I provide an indepth analysis detailing my processes of converting the data into meaningful insights describing the 
differences and distributions in class, gender, age, fare cost etc.
Finally, I predict the likelihood that a passenger survived with machine learning by analysing their age,
socioeconomic status and other variables.

My analysis uses the following modules (packages):
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- RegEx
- Machine Learning (sklearn)
